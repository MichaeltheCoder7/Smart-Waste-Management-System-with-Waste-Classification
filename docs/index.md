# Abstract

This project develops a low-cost, energy-efficient waste classification system using a Raspberry Pi 4 and deep learning. Aimed at improving waste management, the system classifies items into categories like compost, landfill, and recycle using a modified CNN model, such as MobileNetV2. Designed for public and personal use, it features a camera for real-time classification, a user-friendly interface, and data logging for waste pattern analysis. The system aims to enhance recycling rates and reduce pollution by educating users on proper disposal. Key challenges include balancing cost and technological efficiency and developing an effective feedback mechanism. Success will be measured by classification accuracy, user experience, and power consumption. The project draws on current research and utilizes resources like Kaggle's waste datasets and MobileNetV2. Its success could significantly impact waste management processes and environmental awareness.
